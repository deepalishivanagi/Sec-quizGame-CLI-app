    <h3>Welcome to Deepali's second created quiz Game!</h3>
    <h4>Before I start this game quickly wanted you to know how I created this app.</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>I have used replit platform to create this CLI app.</li>
        <li>I have chosen node.js to code this program.</li>
        <li>To take the user inputs I have used readlineSync.</li>
        <li>Used different objects for the bunch of questions.</li>
        <li>To get the questions one by one ,I have kept them in an array & accessed accordingly.</li>
        <li>I have used for loop,if else and functions to make the program less complex & easy to understand.</li>
        <li>For making it attractive I have used chalk in this project</li>
        <li>For displaying the scores & comparing with high scores I have used temp file</li>
        <li>Try out read & write file in your program</li>

    </ul>
    <p>You can also create your own app by exploring in above given things.  </p>
