#My Random quiz game CLI app

This project showcase the 2nd CLI app which I have created in lesson one of level zero in neog.camp.

For this I have coded using node js with additional features like chalk,readlineSync,read-write files,objects in repl.it etc.

It consist of multiple choice questions with levels & shows your score along with the high score.
If answered correctly will get one point.
